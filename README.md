## Scrapper

- [Tropicopia](http://www.tropicopia.com/house-plant/) contains rich metadata for over 350 house plants
- Using [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) we fetch all the meta + image url, and save inside the json file locally
- access [tropicopia - plant](http://www.tropicopia.com/house-plant/detail.np/detail-01.html) to review the available metadata
- if you want fresh data, delete the file inside scrapped_data dir, or del the dir

## Next step/s

- fetch some location based forecast
